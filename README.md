## Description of my portfolio
 A portfolio is used as a curriculum  vitae and purposely for letting  people who want to offer job get more information about the person. The website will act as a template/guide for those people who want to offer their curriculum  vitae as a live link rather than documented hard/soft copy curriculum vitae.
The website is all about my description.
